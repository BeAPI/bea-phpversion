## Screenshots

## Installation

### WordPress

- Consider using it as [mu-plugin](https://codex.wordpress.org/Must_Use_Plugins), install it in `wp-content/mu-plugins`
- Nothing to do then !

### [Composer](http://composer.rarst.net/)

- Add repository source : `{ "type": "vcs", "url": "https://github.com/BeAPI/beapi-phpversion" }`.
- Include `"beapi/beapi-phpversion": "dev-master"` in your composer file for last master's commits or a tag released.
- Nothing to do then !

## Optional

By default it will only print current php version (tidy format) in the dashboard at glance and in admin footer text but if you add a constant in your wp-config (or dotenv) that defines the php version of your project (php version in production) :

	define( 'BEAPI_PHP_VERSION', '7.2' );

it will compare the two versions and if it does not match you will be alerted. It's especially useful when dealing with multiple environments.

## Filters

* _beapi_phpversion_is_allowed_ : default is `is_super_admin()` (which allows only administrators on single installations).
* _beapi_phpversion_success_inline_styles_
* _beapi_phpversion_error_inline_styles_
* _beapi_phpversion_inline_styles_ : global styles
